- Store book information including:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Description
  - Year of release
- Search functionality (coming soon)
- Input validation using Pydantic
- UUID-based book identification

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pydantic

## Installation

git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

## Usage

```python

# Create a new bookstore instance
bookstore = Bookstore()

# Add a new book
book = bookstore.create_book(
    title="The Great Gatsby",
    author="F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    description="A story of decadence and excess",
    year_release=1925
)

# Get all books
